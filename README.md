# UX DESIGN DAY - resources from previous conferences

##Welcome!

Hello! If you’re reading this then you are probably an organiser for a UX Design Day conference somewhere in the world. That’s awesome! Welcome to the family.

In this .zip file I’ve included a bunch of example content from the first conference in Dunedin from April 27. The content here will evolve over time, and the best place to get the most up-to-date set of files will be in the Github repository under the master branch.

The idea is that you will be able to take these assets and examples to form your own set of documents to help you run your own UXDD.

This is still a learning experience for everyone involved, so a lot of things will be left out. If you have any questions, please contact me at benjamin@uxdesignday.org and I’m happy to answer them.

## How much are we allowed to customize our own UX Design Days?

There aren’t many rules around brand usage yet, but as a general guideline, below are a few things that I recommend and would like to see organisers like yourselves do.

## What do we call our conference?

Your conference should be called UX Design Day location year where location is the city it’s in, for example UX Design Day Auckland 2013.

## What topics should we try to cover?

The conference has a digital slant, but you should aim for a lot of variety to keep things interesting. Try focusing on different areas of UX and visual design. See the schedule example, resources, talks on Vimeo, and more to get a feel for what we’re about.

## What website do we point people to?

I will set you up with a subdomain on uxdesignday.org. The format will be location.uxdesignday.org. Note that uxdesignday.com is just a redirect to .org.
￼
## Who do we use for ticketing and attendee payments?

Really that’s up to you. Some providers take more than others. I recommend Chalkle, who are based in Wellington - they’re friendly and awesome.

## Where do we customize our website?

You will get access to the Github repository where you can add your own location-specific information - sponsors, speakers etc. The documentation for that is in the Github repository README file.

## How do we deal with scheduling?

Please keep your schedule and conference format close to the original. If you find there is a better way of doing things, talk to me about changing the global schedule! The idea is that UX Design Day should be fast-paced, compact, practical, and accessible.

## How much should we charge for tickets?

This is up to you. The ticket price should be affordable, and where possible you should try to attract local speakers who are happy to talk for free.

What makes UXDD different to other similar conferences is the fact that local speakers really mix with attendees and it helps to expose new people in your local network you didn’t know before. It’s very satisfying to know that we don’t need to fly out an expert from the valley - there’s one right down the road!

## What do we do with any profits from our conference?

If there are any profits leftover, take 50% for yourselves and your time, and please send 50% back to us at UX DESIGN DAY. This helps cover server costs, my time, Google Apps costs, domain renewals, that sort of thing.

## Who do we approach for sponsorship?

Entirely up to you. However, please only sign on sponsors that are known for practicing good design. We don’t want to tarnish the brand.

##￼How do I attract good speakers?

Usually through your network, meetups, through sponsors, on Twitter, that sort of thing. Try to get people who have spoken before, and make sure you reiterate that their talk should be reasonably short (15 minutes or 30 minutes) and practical.

Attendees should come away with the feeling they’ve learnt something new.

## How often should these conferences be?

If someone else has run a UXDD nearby recently in another city, think about pushing yours out so there’s a gap of about 4 months. UXDD should be an annual event for each city, but in smaller countries (like New Zealand!) we don’t want to oversaturate everyone.

## What font should I use?

Please use Open Sans for everything. You can add Open Sans to Google Docs by using the Add Fonts option in the dropdown. It’s also available as a free web font on Google Web Fonts, and you can download the .ttf files.

## Will I get access to the Twitter and Facebook accounts to promote my conference?

Yes, you will. I will email you the details.

## Will I get an @uxdesignday.org email address?

Not presently, but that may change in the future.

## Is all of this set in concrete?

Absolutely not! I’m learning just as much as you are, and I’ll definitely find things that don’t work well. Please let me know if you have any feedback, questions, concerns, or suggestions.

## I have questions. Who do I contact?

Contact Benjamin Humphrey, benjamin@uxdesignday.org.
