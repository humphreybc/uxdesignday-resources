## UX Design Day - resources

Version: 1.2, last updated: 25 Jan 2014

### Welcome!

Hello! If you’re reading this then you’re probably thinking of running a [UX Design Day](http://uxdesignday.org) conference somewhere in the world. That’s awesome!

In this repository I’ve included a bunch of resources from the first two conferences - Dunedin on April 27 2013 and Wellington on October 10 2013. 

The content here will evolve over time. The best place to get the most up-to-date set of files will be in this very GitHub repository. To download everything as a .zip file, click the button over on the right.

The idea is that you will be able to take these assets and examples to form your own set of material to help you run your own UXDD. We have a heap of templates, marketing resources, previous budgets, schedules, survey results, and more to help you succeed.

If you have any questions, please contact me at [benjamin@uxdesignday.org](mailto:benjamin@uxdesignday.org) and I’m happy to answer them. Otherwise, here are a few frequently asked questions:

#### What is UX Design Day at a glance?

UX Design Day is an open-source, non-profit conference focused on providing an awesome one-day educational event in cities around the world. We aim to raise awareness of good design in every industry, and teach people valuable skills from all experience levels.

Check out the [summary from Wellington 2013](https://github.com/humphreybc/uxdesignday-resources/blob/master/summary/wellington%202013/UX%20Design%20Day%20Wellington%202013%20Summary.pdf?raw=true) to get a feel for what makes a great UX Design Day and of course if you haven’t already visited [uxdesignday.org](http://uxdesignday.org) then do that too.

#### How do I download all of this information?

Click the ‘Download ZIP’ button to the right.

#### How do I become eligible to run a UXDD in my city?

It’s pretty simple, really.

1. Read through all of the material online and get a good feel for what makes a great event
2. Start thinking about a great venue and speakers you might invite
3. Allow yourself 4 months to organise the event
4. Put together a two or three page proposal document and email it to [Benjamin](mailto:benjamin@uxdesignday.org)

#### How much are we allowed to customize our own UX Design Days?

UX Design Days should follow a similar one day, 6 - 12 talk format, and focus on:

* Education through practical talks
* Exposing local speakers and talent
* Accessible and affordable entry
* A unique conference experience

#### What do we call our conference?

Your conference should be called “UX Design Day <city it’s in> <year>”. For example “UX Design Day Sydney 2014”.

It can also be abbreviated to UXDD Sydney 2014, and all hashtags are #uxdd.

#### What topics should we try to cover?

The conference has a digital slant, but you should aim for a lot of variety to keep things interesting. For example, UX Design Day Wellington 2013 had a tattoo artist present a talk alongside digital designers. 

Try focusing on different areas of UX and visual design. See the example schedules, resources, [previous talks on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/uxdesignday/videos), and more to get a feel for what we’re about.

#### What website do we point people to?

After your proposal has been accepted, I will set you up with uxdesignday.org/yourlocation. 

Note: we also have uxdesignday.com, which simply redirects to .org.
￼
#### Who do we use for ticketing and attendee payments?

Really that’s up to you. Some providers take more of a cut than others. I recommend Chalkle, who are based in Wellington, New Zealand - they’re friendly and awesome.

#### How do we customize uxdesignday.org to our liking?

The basic layout and style is set by us, however you can modify the content, such as your own location-specific information - sponsors, speakers etc. Each conference location will have their own branch.

Please submit [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) on your location’s branch in the [UX Design Day Github repository](https://github.com/humphreybc/uxdesignday). It’s a relatively simple static site built with Node.js.

#### How do we deal with scheduling?

Please keep your schedule and conference format close to the original. If you find there is a better way of doing things, talk to me about changing the global schedule! The idea is that UX Design Day should be fast-paced, compact, practical, and accessible.

We’ve found the ideal number of speakers to be around 9. Less than that and people feel they don’t get enough value for money, more than that and people tend to get worn out near the end of the day.

#### How much should we charge for tickets?

This is up to you. The ticket price should be affordable, and where possible you should try to attract local speakers who are happy to talk for free. Since they’re local, they also won’t require accommodation and transport costs.

What makes UXDD different to other similar conferences is the fact that local speakers really mix with attendees and it helps to expose new people in your local network you didn’t know before. It’s very satisfying to know that we don’t need to fly out an expert from the valley - there’s one right down the road!

Dunedin 2013 charged $30.00 NZD for a ticket and Wellington 2013 charged $150.00 NZD for a ticket. We advise that you don’t put the ticket price above $200.00.

#### What do we do with any profits from our conference?

If there are any profits leftover, take 50% for yourself and any other organisers to cover your time, and please send 50% back to us at UX Design Day. This helps cover server costs, our time, Google Apps costs, domain renewals, that sort of thing.

#### Who do we approach for sponsorship?

This is entirely up to you. We have strong relationships with several tech companies in Australia and New Zealand whom we’d be happy to contact. Please only take sponsors that are known for practicing good design. We don’t want to tarnish the brand!

####￼How do I attract good speakers?

Usually through your network, meetups, through sponsors, on Twitter, that sort of thing. Try to get people who have spoken (at other conferences) before, and make sure you reiterate that their talk should be reasonably short (15 minutes or 30 minutes) and practical.

Attendees should come away with the feeling they’ve learnt something new. If you can, try to screen them and their talk before accepting them as a speaker.

#### How often should these conferences be held?

If someone else has run a UXDD nearby recently in another city, think about pushing yours out so there’s a gap of about 4 months. UXDD should be an annual event for each city, but in smaller countries (like New Zealand!) we don’t want to oversaturate the market.

Try to avoid clashing with similar conferences (UX Australia, Webstock, etc).

#### What font should I use?

Please use [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) for everything. You can add Open Sans to Google Docs by using the Add Fonts option in the dropdown. It’s also available as a free web font on Google Web Fonts, and you can download the .ttf files for use in graphic software.

#### Will I get access to the Twitter and Facebook accounts to promote my conference?

Yes, you will. I will email you the details.

#### Will I get a @uxdesignday.org email address?

Not presently, but that may change in the future.

#### Is all of this set in concrete?

Absolutely not! We are learning just as much as you are, and we’ll definitely find things that don’t work well. Please let Benjamin know if you have any feedback, questions, concerns, or suggestions.

#### I have more questions. Who do I contact?
